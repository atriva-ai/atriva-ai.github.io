Recent talks from **Sergey Brin** and **Andrew Ng** share a consistent message: AI will change *how* we code, but it will not remove the need to **understand coding deeply**.

## Real Growth Comes from Real Products
You don’t grow by building the biggest system — or the smallest demo.

You grow by building something *real*.

Atriva AI lives in that sweet spot:
- Not too big to be overwhelming
- Not too small to be meaningless

You work on systems that must:
- Run reliably
- Integrate multiple components
- Handle real data and edge cases

## Coding Is Still the Core Skill
AI tools can generate code, but only **you** can:
- Choose the right architecture
- Debug real failures
- Make trade-offs between performance, cost, and complexity

Only real products force engineers to develop judgment.

Atriva AI gives you a place to practice coding with purpose — where every line of code connects to a working system.
