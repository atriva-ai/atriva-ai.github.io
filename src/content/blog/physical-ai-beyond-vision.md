Is Atriva AI only about edge vision AI?

**Of course not.**

## From Seeing to Acting in the Physical World
Once you have a platform that can **observe and analyze the physical environment**, you are building **Physical AI** — even without robotic arms.

Atriva AI systems can:
- Detect events through vision
- Trigger lights, sounds, sensors, or recordings
- Respond intelligently to real-world situations

Audio-based understanding and listening will be supported in the near future.

## Why LLMs Don’t Watch Everything
No one uses large language models to monitor environments continuously.

Instead:
- Lightweight edge AI observes continuously
- Meaningful events are detected locally
- LLMs or VLMs are invoked *only when needed*

At that point, higher-level models can analyze, summarize, and recommend actions.

This hybrid approach is scalable, cost-effective, and privacy-aware.

## The Only Limitation Is Imagination
From smart spaces to safety systems, Physical AI unlocks a new class of products.

Atriva AI exists to help builders turn these ideas into **working systems**, not just concepts.
