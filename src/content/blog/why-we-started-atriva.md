I started Atriva after spending years in Silicon Valley, working alongside brilliant developers and partners who were all chasing the promise of **Edge AI**. The energy was incredible—every week brought a new proof of concept, a new demo, a new experiment showing how AI at the edge could change the world.  

And yet, there was also a pattern I couldn’t ignore.  

Despite all the enthusiasm, most projects never made it past the **POC stage**. Teams kept running into the same obstacles: every application needed to be rebuilt from scratch, glued together with custom pipelines, device drivers, and inference engines. What should have been weeks of iteration often turned into months of fighting infrastructure.  

I watched developers grow frustrated. Partners who wanted to move fast found themselves bogged down. Instead of focusing on **business value**—understanding what end customers truly needed—teams were stuck reinventing the plumbing over and over again.  

It reminded me of something Jensen Huang once said: *this is the time to build AI factories*. In other words, we need systems that **automate, reuse, and scale** what’s already been built—so we’re not starting from zero every time.  

That idea resonated deeply with me. What if there were a way to give developers **modular building blocks**—a framework for edge AI—that allowed them to focus on the “why” instead of constantly wrestling with the “how”?  

That’s the vision behind Atriva. We’re building a foundation that makes it easier to go from **proof of concept to production**, so developers can spend less time rebuilding infrastructure and more time creating applications that solve real problems.  

The edge AI opportunity is massive, but it’s also fragmented. Our mission is to bring order to that chaos—to help innovators focus on what truly matters: **delivering value to customers**.  

This is the journey we’re on, and I believe it’s just the beginning.
