## 🌍 Why We’re Building This Community

The world of **Edge AI** is evolving rapidly — from smart cameras and robotics to retail analytics and industrial safety.  
Yet most developers, especially **recent CS graduates**, rarely get to build *complete AI products* that integrate real hardware, data, and deployment.

That’s where **Atriva AI Community** comes in.

We’re creating an **open ecosystem** that helps developers learn how to connect AI models, pipelines, and hardware — building **real, deployable Edge AI products** that make an impact.

---

## 🧭 Our Mission

The **Atriva AI Community** helps engineers:

- 💡 Learn **product-thinking** in AI development  
- 🤝 Collaborate on **open, real-world projects**  
- 🧠 Gain experience with **industry-standard tools** (DeepStream, TensorRT, RKNN, OpenVINO)  
- 📦 Build **portfolio-ready Edge AI products**  

Our goal: empower developers to **build, not just train models** — and help them become creators of the next wave of intelligent edge systems.

## 🏗️ What We’ve Launched

As of today, we’ve officially launched the  
👉 **[Atriva AI Community GitHub Organization](https://github.com/atriva-ai-community)**

Our initial repositories include:

- 🧩 [`app-template`](https://github.com/atriva-ai-community/app-template) —  
  A full-stack reference app showing how to assemble a deployable Edge AI solution using open modules.

- 📘 [`community`](https://github.com/atriva-ai-community/community) —  
  Central hub for documentation, contribution guidelines, discussions, and the open roadmap.

- 🧠 Base modules for **inference**, **tracking**, and **analytics pipelines** (coming soon).

Each project is designed to help developers learn how to go from **model to product** — bridging the gap between AI research and real deployments.

## 💡 Our Open-Core Vision

Atriva AI is built on a **hybrid open-core model**:

- 🟢 **Open-source modules**: SDKs, templates, community tools  
- 🔒 **Closed-source infrastructure**: enterprise features, deployment automation, and licensing services  

This approach keeps open learning sustainable — ensuring that contributions remain free and accessible, while allowing the platform to fund developer programs, internships, and community growth.

> “Open innovation with sustainable growth.” — That’s the Atriva AI philosophy.
